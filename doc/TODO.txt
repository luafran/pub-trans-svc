Make the API support multiple agencies
    For NextBus provider
    For different providers
Make the service support multiple providers like NextBus

Install minikube
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.11.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
curl -Lo kubectl http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.3.0/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Notes:
uri stats does not count not found uris. This is basically to prevent unbound grow of redis set
