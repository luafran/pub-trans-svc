An endpoint to retrieve the routes that are not running at a specific time. For example, the 6 bus does
not run between 1 AM and 5 AM, so the output of a query for 2 AM should include the 6.
* Two endpoints to retrieve internal statistics about your service:
    * The total number of queries made to each of the endpoints in your API
    * A list of slow requests
